# FunkyFishAssignment





The Funky Fish is an iOS game application developed in Xcode 8.2.1 and swift 3. The framework used to create this application was SpriteKit – apples framework for making 2D games. The application is developed for all iPhones sizes.

The idea of the game is that the user is above sea level in the main menu and once starting a new game the user is submerged into the sea to the game play screen. This was accomplished by pushing the main menu screen up using a transition thus giving the effect of the game being played under water. Also when the user selects the main menu after a game is finished, the screen is pushed down and the user is taken above sea level to the main menu. 

User manual 

To play the game users can tap either side of the fish to move and collect the falling food. To stay alive users must avoid the falling anchors. 

The intensity of the game increases as the user collects food. This was accomplished by using if statements… So when a user collects coins in increments of 5 the intensity of gravity is increased in both X & Y positions. 


Motivation

The motivation to create this game came about when delivering a bouncy castle names the funky fish tank to a house. The theme of the castle sparked an idea to convert it into an iOS game. 


Design 

All designs for the screens were my own and created in adobe illustrator. Even though the game was inspired by the theme of the funky fish tank bouncy castle the graphics in the game are completely different to that of the castle.


Other similar apps 

As of yet there is no application on the app store with the same idea of food falling into the ocean and feeding a fish.  However there is a game for catching fruit named fruit catcher with the same idea of fruit falling from the sky and the player being killed by falling bombs. 

Future development

In future development of the application the game will include further levels rather than just the intensity of the game increasing as food is collected. 

Also in future development users will be able to challenge friends to a game where the winner collects the most food. 

Additional enemies such as hooks and fish nets will be added to the application in future development.

A social media sharing button will also be added so that when a user finishes a game, their score is displayed and can be shared to their friends on social media platforms already installed to the phone.
